n		Recursive		Looping
10		3300			1300
20		755100			11700
30		7865300			18300
40		754119400		25800
45		7023693100		24200

1) Recursion nanoseconds increase staggeringly higher than the increase for Looping.
4) Looping is faster since it takes less nanoseconds to calculate the Fibonacci number than Recursion.
